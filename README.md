# Full-Stack Development
> Crash-course JavaScript, HTML, and CSS 

## Objective
* This course will teach you the fundamentals of Web Technology
  * HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and even some Python)
  * the difference between client and server-side code   
  * how to build a web server
  * how to communicate bewteen clients and servers using HTTP calls 
  * and other fun things like git (version control) and APIs
* By the end of the course, you'll have built a full-stack Todo-List app

## Instructions
* Each folder includes starter code for the project
* Once you finish one assignment, PM me on UC-One and I'll review it 
* I'll be updating this repository incrementally

## Assignment 1
You're job will be to create the front-end of the Todo-List app. The front-end of a web application is what the user sees. For instance, when you go to YouTube.com, what you, the user, see is the front-end. When you click on a video, the front-end will make a request to the backend for the video data to display to the user.

The Todo-List front end will have several requirements.
1. It must have an `h1` tag, which will display the title of the app: (Call it what you want)
2. It must have a list of elements. The html tags you will use are `ul` and `li`.
3. It must have an image. The image doesn't have anything to do with functionality. It's just good knowledge to know how to display an image.
4. You must designate some styles in main.css, that will link in index.html. Learning how to use relative links and paths is very useful. 
5. You must use the Bulma CSS framework. Read this getting started page in bulma's documentation for how to use the Bulma CDN https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/. 
  1. A hint of what you'll have to do, is link the CSS file in the `head` tags of the index.html page.

An example of what the to-do list can look like is displayed below:

### Tips
1. I'd advise you to code everything on https://www.codepen.io, and then export it from there. If you have trouble copying your codepen project into this repository, just message me.
